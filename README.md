- Reminders to Journal & Meditate – Customizable notifications to help users build consistency.

- Different Meditation Options – Guided, unguided, breathing exercises, and visualization meditations.

- Meditation Playlists – Curated playlists with ambient sounds or guided sessions.

- AI-Powered Insights – The app will analyze journal entries and suggest personalized meditation techniques, affirmations, or breathing exercises based on mood and writing patterns.
